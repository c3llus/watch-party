    participant Client as Video Client
    participant API as API Service
    participant Storage as MinIO/GCS
    participant CDN as Cloudflare CDN
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Note over Client, DB: CDN-friendly video streaming - backend generates signed URLs only

    Client->>API: request HLS playlist + JWT
    API->>API: validate JWT token
    API->>DB: check room access
    DB-->>API: access confirmed
    
    API->>Storage: generate signed URL
    Storage-->>API: signed URL (2h expiry)
    API-->>Client: HLS URL + cache headers

    Note over Client, CDN: direct CDN access bypasses backend

    Client->>CDN: request HLS playlist
    
    alt CDN cache hit
        CDN-->>Client: cached playlist
    else CDN cache miss
        CDN->>Storage: fetch from storage
        Storage-->>CDN: HLS content + headers
        CDN->>CDN: cache for 1 hour
        CDN-->>Client: fresh content
    end

    Note over Client, CDN: video segments served from CDN

    loop video playback
        Client->>CDN: request video segments
        alt CDN cache hit
            CDN-->>Client: cached segments
        else CDN cache miss
            CDN->>Storage: fetch segments
            Storage-->>CDN: video data
            CDN->>CDN: cache for 24 hours
            CDN-->>Client: video segments
        end
    end

    Note over Client, Storage: batch URL generation for performance

    Client->>API: request multiple URLs
    API->>Storage: generate batch signed URLs
    Storage-->>API: multiple signed URLs
    API-->>Client: URL batch response

    Note over Client, CDN: all video delivery via CDN - backend only for auth
